# Genia Pipeline: Flow vs Value

The one rule that makes Genia pipelines predictable:

> **Raw values stay values.  Flows stay flows.  Only explicit bridges cross the boundary.**

Option behavior (`some` / `none`) composes with this rule but does not erase it:
pipelines auto-lift ordinary stages over `some(x)` and short-circuit on `none(...)`,
regardless of whether the pipeline carries values or flows.

Legend: 🟢 Value  🔵 Flow  🟣 Bridge  🔴 Sink

Validation: runnable rows include `[case: <id>]` markers and are executed by pytest. Examples are classified as **Valid** if directly tested, **Likely valid** if not directly tested, **Illustrative** if not runnable, or **Invalid** if contradicted by implementation.

## Teaching model

```text
Value world                          Flow world
─────────────                        ──────────
[1, 2, 3]                            stdin |> lines        ← source bridge
  |> map(f)        polymorphic         |> map(f)
  |> filter(p)     polymorphic         |> filter(p)
  |> sum           value-only          |> collect  ← bridge to value
                                       |> sum      (now value world)
                                       |> each(print) |> run  ← sink
```

Three bridge shapes exist and nothing else crosses the boundary:

| Direction | Bridge | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Value → Flow | `lines(source)`, `evolve()`, `evolve(count)` | Create a lazy single-use flow |
| Flow → Value | `collect(flow)` | Materialize flow into a list |
| Flow → Effect | `run(flow)` | Consume flow for side effects only |

---

## Pipeline invariant contract

These invariants are enforced by the pipeline evaluator and locked by tests under `tests/cases/option/` and `tests/cases/flow/`. Only examples with `[case: <id>]` markers are **Valid**; others are **Likely valid** unless contradicted.

| # | Invariant | Key implication |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Raw values stay raw.** Non-Option values pass through stages without gaining Option wrappers. | `5 \|> add1 \|> double` → `12`, never `some(12)` |
| 2 | **`some(x)` auto-lifts through ordinary stages.** Non-Option-aware stages receive `x`, return wrapped as `some(y)`. | `some(5) \|> add1` → `some(6)` |
| 3 | **`none(...)` short-circuits absolutely.** All remaining stages are skipped — including Option-aware stages like `unwrap_or`. | `none("x") \|> unwrap_or(0)` → `none("x")` |
| 4 | **`none(...)` metadata is preserved exactly.** Reason and context survive short-circuit unchanged. | `none("timeout", {retry: 3}) \|> f \|> g` keeps both fields |
| 5 | **Final result preserves Option structure.** The pipeline boundary does not strip or add wrappers. | `some(5) \|> add1` → `some(6)`, not `6` |
| 6 | **Flow vs Value is orthogonal to Option.** Option propagation works the same in both worlds. | Use `keep_some` for per-item Option filtering in flows |

Recovery pattern: wrap the pipeline, not a single stage.

```text
✗  value |> stages |> unwrap_or(default)     ← short-circuit skips unwrap_or
✓  unwrap_or(default, value |> stages)       ← recovery is outside the pipeline
```

| Helper | Call shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `map` | `map(f, xs)` | Also works as flow stage; polymorphic |
| `filter` | `filter(pred, xs)` | Also works as flow stage; polymorphic |
| `reduce` | `reduce(f, acc, xs)` | Value-only reducer |

| `keep_some` | `keep_some(flow)` or `keep_some(stage, flow)` | Unwraps `some(v)`, drops `none(...)` |
| `keep_some_else` | `keep_some_else(stage, handler, flow)` | Routes `some(v)` forward; `none(...)` to handler |
| `scan` | `scan(step, init, flow)` | Stateful `step(state, item) -> [next_state, output]` |
| `rules` | `refine(..steps)` (preferred), `rules(..fns)` (compatibility) | Stateful flow orchestration |
| `each` | `each(fn, flow)` | Side effects; passes items through |
| `tee` | `tee(flow)` | Returns `[left_flow, right_flow]` |
| `merge` | `merge(f1, f2)` / `merge(pair)` | Concatenates two flows |
| `zip` | `zip(f1, f2)` / `zip(pair)` | Emits `[left, right]` items |

### 🟣 Bridge functions (cross the boundary)

| Helper | Direction | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lines` | Value → Flow | Accepts stdin, list-of-strings, or existing flow |
| `evolve` | (source) → Flow | `evolve()` unbounded, `evolve(count)` bounded |
| `collect` | Flow → Value | Materializes lazy flow into a list |
| `run` | Flow → Effect | Consumes flow; returns `nil` |

### Debug helpers (mode-transparent)

| Helper | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `inspect(value)` | Logs value, returns unchanged |
| `trace(label, value)` | Logs label + value, returns unchanged |
| `tap(fn, value)` | Runs `fn(value)` for side effects, returns unchanged |

## CLI mode selection

| Goal | Mode | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stream stdin through flow stages | `-p 'stage_expr'` | `-p` injects `stdin \|> lines` and final `run` |
| Produce a final collected value | `-c 'source'` or file mode | You control full program shape and materialization |
| File program with `main(argv())` | file mode | Supports trailing args and runtime dispatch |

Pipe mode wraps as `stdin |> lines |> <stage_expr> |> run`.
Do not include explicit `stdin` or `run` in `-p`.
For reducers like `sum` or `count`, use `-c`.

## Rules of thumb

1. **Start from the input.** Stdin or IO? Use `lines` to enter Flow world. Already a list? Stay in Value world.
2. **Stay in one world.** Chain flow stages or chain value stages. Don't mix without an explicit bridge.
3. **Cross explicitly.** `collect` is the only Flow → Value bridge. `lines` is the primary Value → Flow bridge.
4. **Option composes orthogonally.** Pipeline `some`/`none` lifting works the same in both worlds.
5. **Use `keep_some` for stream-level Option filtering.** It is flow-oriented. For single Options, use `map_some`, `flat_map_some`, or `unwrap_or`.
6. **Reducers need values.** `sum`, `count`, `reduce` expect lists, not flows. Use `collect` first.
7. **Direct calls don't lift.** Automatic `some(x)` unwrapping is pipeline-only. Direct `f(some(x))` short-circuits.

## Gotchas

- `nth` is `nth(index, xs)` in normal calls; `xs |> nth(index)` in pipeline style.
- `each(fn)` does not execute until the flow is consumed with `run` or `collect`.
- Flows are single-use; reusing a consumed flow raises a runtime error.
- `keep_some` is flow-oriented, not a list helper.
- Pipe mode already wraps as `stdin |> lines |> <stage_expr> |> run`; do not include explicit `stdin` or `run`.
- `map` and `filter` are polymorphic: they work on both lists and flows, staying in whichever world they receive.
